# Hey 

üòÑ - This was my first project where I used React.js
<br>

To run this project you have to do few steps:

1Ô∏è‚É£ - Write in console npm install
<br>
2Ô∏è‚É£ - After npm start

ü•∏ - This project idea was to make a web-site with diets for people, who want to be super skinny that's why there is used slogan such as "Find out their beauty secret" because all we know that Victroia's secret models always used to be super skinny  

Of course this project is still in development and I have plans to finish it. 

For now there is: 

1Ô∏è‚É£ - Home page
<br>
2Ô∏è‚É£ - Diets page (Empty)
<br>
3Ô∏è‚É£ - Pricing page (Empty)
<br>
4Ô∏è‚É£ - About page (Empty)
<br>
5Ô∏è‚É£ - Sign in button (Which redirect to Sign in page)
6Ô∏è‚É£ = Two Default buttons (Which redirect to Sign in page for now)
